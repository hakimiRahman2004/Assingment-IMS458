                    <h2>Hello! I'm Hakimi</h2>
     <p>
    I was born on 3rd July 2004 at Hospital Sultanah Nur Zahirah (HSNZ) in Terengganu. I am the youngest of four siblings — my eldest sister is 27 years old, my second sister is 28, and my third sister is 20. Growing up in a close‑knit family has shaped my character and inspired a strong sense of belonging and resilience.
</p>
<p>
    My father is from Selangor, and my mother is from Terengganu, allowing me to experience and embrace the rich heritage and traditions of both states. Living in Terengganu has instilled in me a deep appreciation for its beautiful beaches, warm culture, and welcoming communities, all of which have shaped the person I am today.
</p>
<p>
    These early life influences have motivated me to pursue growth and meaningful connections in every endeavor. I am passionate about gaining new knowledge, exploring fresh ideas, and making a positive contribution to the people and environments around me. In the future, I aspire to carry these values forward — combining heritage, integrity, and a drive for continuous improvement to build a successful and rewarding path.
</p>
